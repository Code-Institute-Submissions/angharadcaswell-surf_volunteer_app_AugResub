# 1. Project Goals
The aim of this project is to create a volunteer dashboard for a (fictional) charity called Project Surf. The users will include volunteers and the lead volunteer (admin). 


# 2. User Experience

## 2.1 User Stories 

### Lead volunteer:

1. As a lead volunteer, I need to be able to upload a photo of myself and bio so that other volunteers can familiarise themselves with my face.
2. As a lead volunteer, I need to be able to add sessions (date, time) to the dashbaord, so the volunteers can see the upcoming sessions. 
3. As a lead volunteer, I need to be able to use the app on my phone, so I can be updated and sign up for sesssions on the go. 

### Volunteer:

1. As a volunteer, I need to be able to upload a photo of myself and bio so that other volunteers can familiarise themselves with my face.
2. As a volunteer, I need to be able to see sessions (date, time) on the dashbaord, so I can see the upcoming sessions. 
3. As a volunteer, I need to be able to use the app on my phone, so I can be updated and sign up for sesssions on the go.
4. As a volunteer, I need the dashboard to be clear and easy to use, so I don't get bogged down in volunteering admin.

The design for the dashboard is simple and functional. 

# 3. Sprints

1. Set up Python, database
2. Set up base html/css and create Home app
3. Volunteer log in and sign up
4. Create Session Dashboard app
5. Session dashboard log in (show profiles & sessions in swipe view)
6. Volunteer sessions (lead volunteer (admin) to be able to add new sessions)
7. Profile (volunteers to be able to add bio and profile photo)
8. Testing of site

* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) - Host
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Coding workspace
* [Github/ Github pages](https://github.com/)- Commit my code
* [Am I responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#)- To see display the website as mock ups  
* [Django Alauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
message. 




# 6. Testing  
The sit was tested in Gitpod terminal and Heroku by users and myself on all browsers. The game was also peer reviewed by the Code Institute community. 

## 6.1 Bugs


## 6.2 User testing:
The following issues were discovered during user testing. Users were asked to navigate around the site and also to make intentional mistakes to help check for errors.

They were asked in particular to complete the following tasks:

1. Add something to your basket
